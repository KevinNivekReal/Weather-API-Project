 This is a project to practice API skills through the use of the classic weather API.
It uses the weatherapi.com API for the weather forecast. 
To use this on your own computer, you must make an account with weatherapi.com and replace YOUR_API_KEY_HERE with your API key (and also rename .env-sample to .env).
This project uses Node.js, with the dependency of the dotenv package and express for creating a small web server.
